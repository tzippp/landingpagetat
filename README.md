# Fine Line Tattoo Landing Page

A modern, emotional landing page for a fine line tattoo shop. Built with Next.js and React.

## Features

- Emotional hero section
- Fine line tattoo ideas
- Interactive chat to help users decide on tattoo ideas, size, and placement
- Testimonials/trust section

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
3. Deploy easily to Vercel, Netlify, or your favorite platform

## Adding Your Personal Tattoo Images

1. Create a folder named `images` inside the `public` directory of your project (i.e., `public/images`).
2. Place your personal fine line tattoo images in this folder. Use clear, descriptive filenames (e.g., `rose-tattoo.jpg`, `minimalist-flower.png`).
3. Let your developer (or the AI assistant) know when your images are ready, so they can be integrated into the landing page and carousel.
